# Information complementary enhancement for SNN



## Introduction

the discrete and nondiﬀerentiable nature of spike signals leads to unavoidable losses in the information transmission process of SNNs. To address this problem, we propose an information complementary enhancement method for SNN (ICE-Net). The information complementary enhancement is used to learn the supplementary information by a custom simpliﬁed network module, and passes the supplementary information to the SNN at
each stage.

### Dataset

The dataset will be download automatically.

## Get Started


```
cd ICE_SNN
python train.py 
```

The default time step T=4, if you want to change the time step and other parameters, please go to the corresponding place in the train.py file to change it
