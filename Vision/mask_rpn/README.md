# Mask rpn for SNN in object detection



## Introduction

SNN has poor performance in the field of target detection due to its characteristic spike driving method, this study proposes the mask_rpn module to do target detection based on the properties of spiking neural networks

### Dataset

The dataset is VOC or COCO

## Get Started


```
cd mask_rpn
python train_fpn.py 
```

The default time step T=4, if you want to change the time step and other parameters, please go to the corresponding place in the nets/frcnn_mask_fpn_training.py file to change it
