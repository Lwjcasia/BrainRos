# Spiking haptic



## Introduction

Detection for a field haptic system for carts using a combination of spiking neurons and one-dimensional convolutions

## Dataset

The dataset needs to be constructed by you.

## How to construct a dataset?

First of all, you need to use ardiuno to run the "haptic.ino" file in the folder, and use "readtxt.py" to accept the data from ardiuno, and then run "toexcel.py" to convert the txt file into an excel file, and you have a data set of your own!
## Get Started


```
cd Haptic
start haptic.ino
python readtxt.py
python toexcel.py
python main.py 
```

The default time step T=4, if you want to change the time step and other parameters, please go to the corresponding place in the model.py or main.py file to change it
