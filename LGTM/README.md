## LGTM

This repo contains source codes for the PR paper LGTM. Model weights on the ImageNet datasets are available at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uCx9lseB5IL6Yazi2YBn5w?pwd=59bm 提取码: 59bm.


The source codes for different datasets are stored in the corresponding directories, and the tensorboard logs are stored in the subdirectories. For example, the source codes for the CIFAR10 dataset are located in `./cifar10`, and the tensorboard logs are located in `./cifar10/logs`. 

## Thanks
